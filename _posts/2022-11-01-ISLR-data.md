Lots of R packages come with datasets that are easily loaded into R using the `data()` function.
I've recently been reading *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani (available for free from their [website](https://www.statlearning.com){:target="_blank"}), and the book has exercises that readers can do in R.
They have an R package, called `ISLR2`, that includes several of the datasets used in the book and exercises. 
While these data are easy to load into R, I wanted to have a way that I could use them anywhere.
So, I wrote this [R script](https://github.com/LukeMoraglia/ISLR_datasets/blob/master/save_ISLR_datasets.R){:target="_blank"} to save each dataset into a .csv, and put a [repo](https://github.com/LukeMoraglia/ISLR_datasets){:target="_blank"} with all of the .csv files on GitHub.

```r
# File: save_ISLR_datasets.R
library(ISLR2)
library(readr)

# Load list of datasets
datasets <- data(package = "ISLR2")
# Pull out vector of dataset names
dataset_names <- datasets$results[,"Item"]

# Create directory to save the .csv files
dir_for_data <- "data"
dir.create(dir_for_data)

# Function to save a dataset to a csv given its name
save_dataset_to_csv <- function(dataset_name){
  data(list = dataset_name)
  dataset_to_save <- get(dataset_name)
  if(!is.data.frame(dataset_to_save)){
    return(paste0("Failed to save ", dataset_name))
  }
  write_csv(dataset_to_save, file = paste0(dir_for_data, "/", dataset_name, ".csv"))
  return(paste0("Saved ", dataset_name))
}

sapply(dataset_names, save_dataset_to_csv)
```

At present, it only saves datasets that are `data.frame`s.
This code could be easily modified to save datasets from any package or save them to formats other than .csv.
