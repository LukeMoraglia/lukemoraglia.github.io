Below is a collection of some of the work I've done or contributed to!

## PLSMFA

For my first year project in my PhD, I developed a new multivariate analysis called
partial least squares multiple factor analysis (PLSMFA).
Say that five times fast. 
- The [R package](https://github.com/LukeMoraglia/PLSMFA) that I wrote to perform the analysis is available on my GitHub. 
- I gave a talk on the technique at the Psychology Lecture Series at UT Dallas, and the video is available [here](https://youtu.be/0jy-_ix8xz0){:target="_blank"} (it's not all statistics, there's a healthy dose
of beer, too).

## O*NET Shiny App

Currently in development, a Shiny App for visualizing PCA and hierarchical clustering on occupation data obtained from [O*NET](https://www.onetonline.org){:target="_blank"}. 
- The [app](https://lukemoraglia.shinyapps.io/ONETrowClust/){:target="_blank"} is available online.
- The [code](https://github.com/juchiyu/OccupationPCAs){:target="_blank"} for the app and the forthcoming publication are available on GitHub.
