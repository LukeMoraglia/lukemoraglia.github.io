Below is a collection of some of the work I've done or contributed to!

## PLSMFA

For my first year project in my PhD, I developed a new multivariate analysis called
partial least squares multiple factor analysis (PLSMFA).
Say that five times fast. 
- The [R package](https://github.com/LukeMoraglia/PLSMFA){:target="_blank"} that I wrote to perform the analysis is available on my GitHub. 
- I gave a talk on the technique at the Psychology Lecture Series at UT Dallas, and the video is available [here](https://youtu.be/0jy-_ix8xz0){:target="_blank"} (it's not all statistics, there's a healthy dose
of beer, too).

## O*NET Shiny App

Currently in development, a Shiny App for visualizing PCA and hierarchical clustering on occupation data obtained from [O*NET](https://www.onetonline.org){:target="_blank"}. 
- The [app](https://lukemoraglia.shinyapps.io/ONETrowClust/){:target="_blank"} is available online.
- The [code](https://github.com/juchiyu/OccupationPCAs){:target="_blank"} for the app and the forthcoming publication are available on GitHub. 

## *Git & GitHub Tutorial for Scientists: Itâ€™s Not Only for Programmers*

The miraculous [Micaela Chan](https://micaelachan.com){:target="_blank"} wrote a [great book](https://gitbookdown.dallasdatascience.com){:target="_blank"} that is an introduction to git and GitHub.
It's geared towards scientists who don't consider themselves programmers, but who write code and therefore should use git!
Even as someone who identifies as a programmer, I find the book to be extremely helpful, and I come back to it as a reference every now and then. 
Recently, I had the honor of writing a short section in [Chapter 11](https://gitbookdown.dallasdatascience.com/revert-to-a-previous-commit-git-checkout.html){:target="_blank"} on `git revert`.
